# Meeting Detail Troubleshooting Guide

## âœ… GOOD NEWS: Your app is working correctly!

Based on the logs, your **local development server is working perfectly**:
- âœ… Meeting data is being fetched
- âœ… Transcripts are being retrieved  
- âœ… Summaries are being retrieved
- âœ… Action items are being retrieved
- âœ… Pages are rendering with full HTML (88KB response)

## âœ… Railway is also now healthy!

The OpenAI SDK fix has been deployed and services are initializing correctly.

## The Issue

You likely tried to view meetings that were processed BEFORE the fix was deployed.
Those meetings might have failed processing silently.

## Solution - Test with a NEW meeting

1. **Go to Railway**: https://unthinkable-meeting-summarizer-production.up.railway.app/

2. **Upload a new audio file** (use a small test file, 1-2 minutes)

3. **Wait for processing to complete** (watch the processing page)

4. **Click on the newly processed meeting** from the meetings list

5. **You should now see**: Transcript, Summary, and Action Items!

## If you still don't see data

Check the debug endpoint for a specific meeting:
```
https://unthinkable-meeting-summarizer-production.up.railway.app/debug/meeting/<MEETING_ID>/
```

Replace `<MEETING_ID>` with the actual meeting number.

This will show you JSON data with:
- Meeting status
- Whether transcript exists
- Whether summary exists
- Action items count

## Example

For meeting #5:
```
https://unthinkable-meeting-summarizer-production.up.railway.app/debug/meeting/5/
```

## What happens when you click a meeting?

1. URL: `/meeting/<id>/`
2. View checks: Is processing complete?
3. If YES: Fetch transcript, summary, action items
4. If NO: Redirect to processing page
5. Render detail page with all data

## Railway-specific notes

- Old meetings (processed before the OpenAI SDK fix) might have:
  - `status = 'processing'` (stuck)
  - `status = 'failed'` (error)
  - `status = 'completed'` but NO transcript/summary (silent failure)

- New meetings (after the fix) should process correctly!

## Local testing works perfectly!

Your local server at http://127.0.0.1:8001/ shows everything working:
- Meeting #59: Processed successfully
- Meeting #55: Data retrieved successfully
- All pages rendering correctly

## Next steps

1. Upload a new meeting on Railway
2. Let it process completely
3. View the meeting detail page
4. It should work! ðŸŽ‰

If it still doesn't work, check:
- Browser console for JavaScript errors (F12 â†’ Console)
- Network tab for failed requests (F12 â†’ Network)
- Use the debug endpoint to verify data exists
